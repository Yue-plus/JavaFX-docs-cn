== Styleable Properties
A JavaFX property can be styled via css by using a StyleableProperty. This is useful when controls need properties that can be set via css.

In order to use a StyleableProperty on a Control, one needs to create a new CssMetaData using the StyleableProperty. CssMetaData created for a control
needs to be added to the List<CssMetaData> obtained from the control's ancestor. This new list is then returned from the `getControlCssMetaData()`.

By convention, control classes that have CssMetaData will implement a static method getClassCssMetaData() and it is
customary to have getControlCssMetaData() simply return getClassCssMetaData(). The purpose of getClassCssMetaData() is
to allow sub-classes to easily include the CssMetaData of some ancestor.

[source,java]
----
// StyleableProperty
private final StyleableProperty<Color> color =
    new SimpleStyleableObjectProperty<>(COLOR, this, "color");

// Typical JavaFX property implementation
public Color getColor() {
    return this.color.getValue();
}
public void setColor(final Color color) {
    this.color.setValue(color);
}
public ObjectProperty<Color> colorProperty() {
    return (ObjectProperty<Color>) this.color;
}

// CssMetaData
private static final CssMetaData<MY_CTRL, Paint> COLOR =
    new CssMetaData<MY_CTRL, Paint>("-color", PaintConverter.getInstance(), Color.RED) {

    @Override
    public boolean isSettable(MY_CTRL node) {
        return node.color == null || !node.color.isBound();
    }

    @Override
    public StyleableProperty<Paint> getStyleableProperty(MY_CTRL node) {
        return node.color;
    }
};

private static final List<CssMetaData<? extends Styleable, ?>> STYLEABLES;
static {
    // Fetch CssMetaData from its ancestors
    final List<CssMetaData<? extends Styleable, ?>> styleables =
        new ArrayList<>(Control.getClassCssMetaData());
    // Add new CssMetaData
    styleables.add(COLOR);
    STYLEABLES = Collections.unmodifiableList(styleables);
}

// Return all CssMetadata information
public static List<CssMetaData<? extends Styleable, ?>> getClassCssMetaData() {
    return STYLEABLES;
}

@Override
public List<CssMetaData<? extends Styleable, ?>> getControlCssMetaData() {
    return getClassCssMetaData();
}
----

Creation of StyleableProperty and CssMetaData needs a lot of boiler-plate code and this can be reduced by using https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/css/StyleablePropertyFactory.html[StyleablePropertyFactory].
StyleablePropertyFactory contains methods to create StyleableProperty with corresponding CssMetaData.

[source,java]
----
// StyleableProperty
private final StyleableProperty<Color> color =
    new SimpleStyleableObjectProperty<>(COLOR, this, "color");

// Typical JavaFX property implementation
public Color getColor() {
    return this.color.getValue();
}
public void setColor(final Color color) {
    this.color.setValue(color);
}
public ObjectProperty<Color> colorProperty() {
    return (ObjectProperty<Color>) this.color;
}

// StyleablePropertyFactory
private static final StyleablePropertyFactory<MY_CTRL> FACTORY =
    new StyleablePropertyFactory<>(Control.getClassCssMetaData());

// CssMetaData from StyleablePropertyFactory
private static final CssMetaData<MY_CTRL, Color> COLOR =
    FACTORY.createColorCssMetaData("-color", s -> s.color, Color.RED, false);â€¨

// Return all CssMetadata information from StyleablePropertyFactory
public static List<CssMetaData<? extends Styleable, ?>> getClassCssMetaData() { 
    return FACTORY.getCssMetaData(); 
}

@Override public List<CssMetaData<? extends Styleable, ?>> getControlCssMetaData() { 
    return getClassCssMetaData(); 
}

== Tasks
This article demonstrates how to use a JavaFX Task to keep the UI responsive.  It is imperative that any operation taking more than a few hundred milliseconds be executed on a separate Thread to avoid locking up the UI.  A Task wraps up the sequence of steps in a long-running operation and provides callbacks for the possible outcomes.

The *Task* class also keeps the user aware of the operation through properties which can be bound to UI controls like ProgressBars and Labels.  The binding dynamically updates the UI.  These properties include

. *runningProperty* - Whether or not the Task is running
. *progressProperty* - The percent complete of an operation
. *messageProperty* - Text describing a step in the operation

=== Demonstration

The following screenshots show the operation of an HTML retrieval application.

Entering a URL and pressing "Go" will start a JavaFX Task.  When running, the Task will make an HBox visible that contains a ProgressBar and a Label.  The ProgressBar and Label are updated throughout the operation.

image::images/best-practices/tasks_pb.png[title="Screenshot of App Showing ProgressBar and Label"]

When the retrieval is finished, a succeeded() callback is invoked and the UI is updated.  Note that the succeeded() callback takes place on the FX Thread, so it is safe to manipulate controls.

image::images/best-practices/tasks_contents.png[title="Screenshot of App Showing Successful Retrieval"]

If there was an error retrieving the HTML, a failed() callback is invoked and an error Alert is shown.  failed() also takes place on the FX Thread.  This screenshot shows invalid input. An "h" is used in the URL instead of the correct "http".

image::images/best-practices/tasks_error.png[title="Screenshot of App Showing Failure"]

=== Code

An event handler is placed on the Get HTML Button which creates the Task.  The entry point of the Task is the call() method which starts by calling updateMessage() and updateProgress().  These methods are executed on the FX Thread and will result in updates to any bound properties.

The program proceeds by issuing an HTTP GET using standard java.net classes.  A String "retval" is built up from the retrieved characters.  The message and progress properties are updated with more calls to updateMessage() and updateProgress().  The call() method ends with a return of the String containing the HTML text.

On a successful operation, the succeeded() callback is invoked.  getValue() is a Task method that will return the value accrued in the Task (recall "retval").  The type of the value is what is provided in the generic argument, in this case "String".  This could be a complex type like a domain object or a Collection.  The succeeded() operation runs on the FX Thread, so the getValue() String is directly set on the TextArea.

If the operation failed, an Exception is thrown.  The Exception is caught by the Task and converted to a failed() call.  failed() is also FX Thread-safe and it displays an Alert.

[source,java]
----
String url = tfURL.getText();

Task<String> task = new Task<String>() {

    @Override
    protected String call() throws Exception {

        updateMessage("Getting HTML from " + url );
        updateProgress( 0.5d, 1.0d );

        HttpURLConnection c = null;
        InputStream is = null;
        String retval = "";

        try {

            c = (HttpURLConnection) new URL(url).openConnection();

            updateProgress( 0.6d, 1.0d );
            is = c.getInputStream();
            int ch;
            while( (ch=is.read()) != -1 ) {
                retval += (char)ch;
            }

        } finally {
            if( is != null ) {
                is.close();
            }
            if( c != null ) {
                c.disconnect();
            }
        }

        updateMessage("HTML retrieved");
        updateProgress( 1.0d, 1.0d );

        return retval;
    }

    @Override
    protected void succeeded() {
        contents.setText( getValue() );
    }

    @Override
    protected void failed() {
        Alert alert = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.ERROR, getException().getMessage() );
        alert.showAndWait();
    }
};
----

Notice that the Task does not update the ProgressBar and status Label directly.  Instead, the Task makes safe calls to updateMessage() and updateProgress().  To update the UI, JavaFX binding is used in the following statements.

[source,java]
----
bottomControls.visibleProperty().bind( task.runningProperty() );
pb.progressProperty().bind( task.progressProperty() );
messageLabel.textProperty().bind( task.messageProperty() );
----

Task.runningProperty is a boolean that can be bound to the bottomControls HBox visibleProperty.  Task.progressProperty is a double that can be bound to the ProgressBar progressProperty.  Task.messageProperty is a String that can be bound to the status Label textProperty.

To run the Task, create a Thread providing the Task as a constructor argument and invoke start().

[source,java]
----
new Thread(task).start();
----

For any long-running operation -- File IO, the Network -- use a JavaFX Task to keep your application responsive.  The JavaFX Task gives your application a consistent way of handling asynchronous operations and exposes several properties that can be used to eliminate boilerplate and programming logic.

=== Complete Code

The code can be tested in a single .java file.

== Avoid Nulls in ComboBoxes
To use a `ComboBox` in JavaFX, declare a List of items and set an initial value using setValue().  The `ComboBox` method getValue() retrieves the currently selected value.  If an initial value is not provided, the control defaults to a null value.

The null value is a problem when the `ComboBox` drives other logic like an upper-case transformation or the lookup of a database record.  While a null check is usually used to prevent this type of error, an empty object is preferred in order to simplify the code.  ComboBoxes often appear in clusters and the empty object technique reduces null checks in the interaction of related ComboBoxes and on save and load operations.

This article presents a pair of related ComboBoxes.  A country selection in one `ComboBox` modifies the list of available city items in a second `ComboBox`.  Neither selection is required.  The user can press the Save `Button` at any time and if no selection is made for either `ComboBox`, an empty object -- in this case an empty String -- will be returned.

This is a screenshot of the app.  Selecting "Switzerland" from an empty initial value will fill the city `ComboBox` with Swiss cities.  Selecting the city "Zurich" and pressing Save will retrieve those values.

image::images/best-practices/nonullcombo_screenshot.png[title="Related ComboBoxes"]

=== Data Structure

The data structures supporting the app are a List of countries and a Map of cities.  The Map of cities uses country as a key.

[source,java]
.NoNullComboApp.class
----
public class NoNullComboApp extends Application {

    private List<String> countries = new ArrayList<>();

    private Map<String, List<String>> citiesMap = new LinkedHashMap<>();

    private void initData() {

        String COUNTRY_FR = "France";
        String COUNTRY_DE = "Germany";
        String COUNTRY_CH = "Switzerland";

        countries.add(COUNTRY_FR); countries.add(COUNTRY_DE); countries.add(COUNTRY_CH);

        List<String> frenchCities = new ArrayList<>();
        frenchCities.add("Paris");
        frenchCities.add("Strasbourg");

        List<String> germanCities = new ArrayList<>();
        germanCities.add("Berlin");
        germanCities.add("Cologne");
        germanCities.add("Munich");

        List<String> swissCities = new ArrayList<>();
        swissCities.add("Zurich");

        citiesMap.put(COUNTRY_FR, frenchCities );
        citiesMap.put(COUNTRY_DE, germanCities );
        citiesMap.put(COUNTRY_CH, swissCities );
    }
----

To retrieve the set of cities for a given country, use the get() method of the Map.  The containsKey() method can be used to determine whether or not the Map contains a value for the specified country.  In this example, containsKey() will be used to handle the empty object case.

=== UI

The UI is a pair of ComboBoxes with Labels and a Save Button.  The controls are put in a `VBox` and left-justified.  The `VBox` is wrapped in a `TilePane` and centered.  The `TilePane` was used since it does not stretch the `VBox` horizontally.

[source,java]
.NoNullComboApp.class
----
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {

        Label countryLabel = new Label("Country:");
        country.setPrefWidth(200.0d);
        Label cityLabel = new Label("City:");
        city.setPrefWidth(200.0d);
        Button saveButton = new Button("Save");

        VBox vbox = new VBox(
                countryLabel,
                country,
                cityLabel,
                city,
                saveButton
        );
        vbox.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER_LEFT );
        vbox.setSpacing( 10.0d );

        TilePane outerBox = new TilePane(vbox);
        outerBox.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER);

        Scene scene = new Scene(outerBox);

        initData();
----

=== Initial Values

As mentioned earlier, if a value is not specified for a `ComboBox`, then null will be returned in a getValue() call.  Although there are several defensive techniques -- if checks, Commons StringUtils methods -- for fending off NullPointerExceptions, it is better to avoid them completely.  This is especially true as the interactions become complex or there are several ComboBoxes that allow empty selections.

[source,java]
.NoNullComboApp.class
----
        country.getItems().add("");
        country.getItems().addAll( countries );
        country.setValue( "" );  // empty selection is object and not null

        city.getItems().add("");
        city.setValue( "" );
----

In this app, the Country `ComboBox` will not  be changed, so its items are added in the start() method.  Country starts with an initial empty selection as does city.  City -- at this point -- contains a single empty item.

=== Interaction

When the country value is changed, the contents of the city `ComboBox` should be replaced.  It is common to use clear() on the backing list; however, this will produce a null value in the `ComboBox` (no items, no value).  Instead, use removeIf() with a clause to keep a single empty item.  With the list cleared of all data (except the empty item), the newly-selected contents can be added with addAll().

[source,java]
.NoNullComboApp.class
----
        country.setOnAction( (evt) -> {

            String cty = country.getValue();

            city.getItems().removeIf( (c) -> !c.isEmpty() );

            if( citiesMap.containsKey(cty) ) {  // not an empty key
                city.getItems().addAll( citiesMap.get(cty) );
            }
        });

        saveButton.setOnAction( (evt) -> {
           System.out.println("saving country='" + country.getValue() +
                                      "', city='" + city.getValue() + "'");
        });
----

The Save Button action will print out the values.  In no case will a null value be returned from getValue().

If you're a Java developer, you've written "if not null" thousands of times.  Yet, project after project, I see NullPointerExceptions highlighting cases that were missed or new conditions that have arisen.  This article presented a technique for keeping empty objects in ComboBoxes by setting an initial value and using removeIf() rather than clear() when changing lists.  Although, this example used String objects, this can be expanded to work with domain objects that have an hashCode/equals implementation, an empty object representation, and a cellFactory or toString() to produce an empty view.

=== Complete Code

The code can be tested in a single .java file.

                countryLabel,
                country,
                cityLabel,
                city,
                saveButton
        );

== Writing Javadoc for JavaFX Properties

=== Background

Documenting JavaFX APIs may not appear very different from documenting a Java API but most of us are unaware of the tools present to ease our work.

While writing a JavaFX application or designing a JavaFX control, a developer adds various JavaFX properties which _normally_ consists of a field and three methods i.e. JavaFX property method, setter and getter. These methods are generally _public_ and therefore, should be documented. Writing Javadoc for all the three methods doesn't makes sense when most of it is implied. Nevertheless, there should be some documentation and a way to show a link between all these methods.

The JavaFX team has been very thoughtful and introduced a special option "*-javafx*" for the javadoc command. This option introduces the following flexibility:

 * Generates HTML documentation using the JavaFX extensions to the standard doclet. The generated documentation includes a "Property Summary" section in addition to the other summary sections generated by the standard Java doclet. The listed properties are linked to the sections for the getter and setter methods of each property.
 * If there are no documentation comments written explicitly for getter and setter methods, the documentation comments from the property method are automatically copied to the generated documentation for these methods.
 * Adds a new *@defaultValue* tag that allows documenting the default value for a property.
 * Adds a new *@treatAsPrivate* tag that adds the flexibility to not publish the doc for a public method which is a part of the implementation detail.

javadoc -javafx MyClass.java -d testdir
----


=== Example
Generally, if you introduce a JavaFX property field, you will add its corresponding property method along with setter and getter. In this case, you are advised to bundle them together and document _only_ the field. The "-javafx" option on the javadoc command will generate the appropriate documentation for the rest of the methods.

*N.B.* - You can document an individual method in case you want to add explicit information for the method.

== Ignoring Warnings for Null Select Binding Expressions
When working with the JavaFX Bindings class, you may get evaluation warnings in the console log.  This scenario arises when using a binding expression on an object that may be null.  For example, a `TableView` selection may drive the enabled state of Buttons.  When the `TableView` is first displayed, there is no selection.  This will display an error in the log of level WARNING.

WARNING: Exception while evaluating select-binding [taxable]
----

"taxable" is a Boolean property on a POJO.  The expression that caused this message is the following.

[source,java]
----
    btnCalcTax.disableProperty().bind(
        tblItems.getSelectionModel().selectedItemProperty().isNull().or(
                Bindings.select(
                    tblItems.getSelectionModel().selectedItemProperty(),
                    "taxable"
                ).isEqualTo(false)
        )
    );
----

The preceding statement disables the Calc Tax Button when there is no table selection or if there is a table selection, the selected item has its taxable field set to false.  That is, the Calc Tax Button should only be enabled when a taxable item is selected.

JavaFX Bindings uses Java Logging, so raising the verbosity to SEVERE will ignore the WARNING level message.  Conversely, if you want to lower the verbosity to see the stack trace supporting the WARNING, lower the verbosity to FINE.  This statement is added to a logging.properties file.  The program can be instructed to use that file by specifying -Djava.util.logging.config.file in the command.

[source,shell]
----
javafx.beans.level=SEVERE
----

For a quick check that does not require a separate file or command modification, you can add this to your program.  Because of the dependency on Sun classes, you should remove this prior to committing.

[source,java]
----
Logging.getLogger().setLevel(PlatformLogger.Level.FINE )
----

The JavaFX WARNING may be too strong for a common use case.  There is a ticket JDK-8162600 that may address this in a later JavaFX release.

== POJO Binding

In larger apps involving non-JavaFX technologies, sharing POJOs is a great way to help with maintenance.  Doing an impact analysis is quicker when an IDE can search for common accesses and extensions.  Moreover, POJO-based validation, logic, and utilities can also be reused.

JavaFX has a collection of static methods in the `Bindings` class to work with both POJOs and JavaFX-enabled Properties.  This section demonstrates the use of the select() method which will link the core data types from a POJO to the JavaFX Property-based fields of a UI control.  Once the core data type is repackaged as a Property, additional functionality from JavaFX can be chained such as string concantenation.

Because the data in this demonstration app is based on a POJO, an update needs to be made manually.  Bi-directional binding works only when the source and the target are both Properties.  This app uses a Track class with core data type fields like String: "album".  If the Track class were written using JavaFX properties -- say StringProperty : album -- then a model change would automatically update the UI.  A hybrid approach is presented whereby the core data type on one of the POJO fields initializes a separate JavaFX Property field and the update operation must change both fields.

=== The POJOs

Two POJOs are used: Track and Rating.  Track contains information about a music clip being played: album, artist, track name.

[source,java]
.Track.java (abbreviated)
----
public class Track {

    private String artist;
    private String album;
    private String track;
    private Integer trackNo;
    private Rating rating;
    private Boolean downloaded;
----

Rating is a pairing of a value (ex, 3) and a scale (ex, max value of 5).  There is a Rating member in a Track which will show the Bindings.select() nesting syntax.

[source,java]
.Rating.java (abbreviated)
----
public class Rating {

    private Float value;
    private Float scale;
----

**** 
The construtor, getters, and setters have been left off for brevity and are included in the source download.
****

In the Application subclass, the model is a single field "currentTrack".

[source,java]
.BindingsSelectApp.java
----
public class BindingsSelectApp extends Application {

    private final Track currentTrack = new Track(
            "Jaco Pastorious",
            "Jaco Pastorious",
            "Come On, Come Over",
            2,
            new Rating(4.99f, 5.00f),
            false
    );
----

Referring to the previous screenshot, the currentTrack fields are displayed in the TextFields().  "rating" is supplemented with a formatted String.

=== UI Code

The `TextField` controls and the Download `Button` are also Application subclass fields so that they can be used in both the Application.start() method and a private initBindings() method.

[source,java]
.BindingsSelectApp.java (cont.)
----
    private final TextField tfArtist = new TextField();
    private final TextField tfAlbum = new TextField();
    private final TextField tfTrack = new TextField();
    private final TextField tfTrackNo = new TextField();
    private final TextField tfRating = new TextField();
    private final TextField tfDownloaded = new TextField();

    private final Button downloadButton = new Button("Download");

    private final BooleanProperty downloaded = new SimpleBooleanProperty(currentTrack, "downloaded");
----

"downloaded" is a special JavaFX Property maintained alongside the field of the same name in the currentTrack object.  As mentioned earlier, the POJO will need to be updated manually.  The BooleanProperty "downloaded" is a convenience that keeps the app from having to modify the tfDownload TextField directly.

The start() method begins by creating the top `GridPane` container and adding the TextField and `Label` controls.

[source,java]
.BindingsSelectApp.java (cont.)
----
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {

        GridPane gp = new GridPane();

        gp.add(new Label("Artist"), 0, 0);
        gp.add(tfArtist, 1, 0);
        gp.add(new Label("Album"), 0, 1);
        gp.add(tfAlbum, 1, 1);
        gp.add(new Label("Track"), 0, 2);
        gp.add(tfTrack, 1, 2);
        gp.add(new Label("#"), 0, 3);
        gp.add(tfTrackNo, 1, 3);
        gp.add(new Label("Rating"), 0, 4);
        gp.add(tfRating, 1, 4);
        gp.add(new Label("Downloaded"), 0, 5);
        gp.add(tfDownloaded, 1, 5);

        gp.setHgap(4.0d);
        gp.setVgap(8.0d);

        VBox.setVgrow(gp, Priority.ALWAYS);
        VBox.setMargin( gp, new Insets(40.0d) );
----

A `ButtonBar` container is used to hold the Download Button.  The ButtonBar and GridPane are added to a `VBox` and separated via a `Separator`.

[source,java]
.BindingsSelectApp.java (cont.)
----
        ButtonBar buttons = new ButtonBar();

        ButtonBar.setButtonData(downloadButton, ButtonBar.ButtonData.OTHER);

        buttons.getButtons().add(downloadButton);
        buttons.setPadding(new Insets(10.0d) );

        VBox vbox = new VBox(
                gp,
                new Separator(),
                buttons
        );
----

=== Bindings

The bindings statements are in a private method "initBindings" which is called from the Application.start() method.

[source,java]
.BindingsSelectApp.java (cont.)
----
    private void initBindings() {

        tfArtist.textProperty().bind( Bindings.select(currentTrack, "artist"));
        tfAlbum.textProperty().bind( Bindings.select(currentTrack, "album"));
        tfTrack.textProperty().bind( Bindings.select(currentTrack, "track"));

        tfTrackNo.textProperty().bind(
                Bindings.select(currentTrack, "trackNo").asString()
        );

        tfRating.textProperty().bind(
                Bindings.concat(
                    Bindings.select(currentTrack, "rating", "value").asString(),
                    " out of ",
                    Bindings.select(currentTrack, "rating", "scale").asString()
                )
        );

        tfDownloaded.textProperty().bind(downloaded.asString());
        downloadButton.disableProperty().bind(downloaded);
    }
----

==== Bindings.select

Bindings.select is a static method that creates a typed binding from a plain object or an ObservableValue.  In this example, a POJO is passed in along with either a field name or a set of field names that form an object path.  For the artist, album, and track fields, the value returned from select() is a StringBinding and is compatible with the textProperty() of the TextFields.  The trackNo select() call will return an IntegerBinding which is not compatible with textProperty() so a method asString() is added to convert the IntegerBinding into a StringBinding.  asString() is also used for the special "downloaded" member variable which returns a BooleanBinding that throws a ClassCastException.

tfRating is bound to a complex expression.  The components of tfRating are the value (ex "4.99") and the scale ("5.0").  A string constant " out of " is set in the middle of the expression.  The joining of expressions is performed by the contact() method which returns the formatted string displayed in the UI.  Notice that this select() call uses a path which is a varargs collection of field names.  Passing "rating" then "value" is used for the object path currentTrack.rating.value.  currentTrack.rating.scale is accessed similarly.

There is an additional binding disabling the Downloaded Button if the track has already been downloaded.  Like the binding to tfDownloaded, the Bindings.select() method is skipped for a direct bind() call since the member variable "downloaded" is a JavaFX Property.  This "downloaded" Property is initialized with the POJO value which is a field on the currentTrack object.

==== Model Update

Since the model is based on the POJO "currentTrack", the fields must be updated manually.  In some architectures, this is desired since the POJO represents record state (the state of the data from the app) and not the screen state (what the user is looking at).  This means that a deliberate setter must be made to update record state and that needs to trigger a screen state update.

image::images/best-practices/bindings_select_downloaded_screenshot.png[title="A Model Change Disables the Download Button"]

In this example, there is only one field that will be modified: downloaded.  Pressing the Download Button will call a setter on the special downloaded BooleanProperty of the Application.  When the value of the BooleanProperty changes, the UI is updated from the tfDownloaded binding.  A ChangeListener is attached to the downloaded BooleanProperty which triggers an update of the model state.

[source,java]
.BindingsSelectApp.java (cont.)
----
        downloadButton.setOnAction( (evt) -> {
            downloaded.set(true);
        });

        downloaded.addListener( (obs,ov,nv) -> currentTrack.setDownloaded(true));
----

The Download Button serves as a commit.  While the user is limited in this app, they could edit the TextFields and use a Save Button to transfer the values on the screen to the model.  Additionally, a Reset Button could discard TextField changes.

The declarative binding of JavaFX UI controls to Properties enforces a consistent style and behavior throughout the application.  Similar functionality can be accomplished by directly accessing the controls ("setText()") and retrieving updates from addListener().  However, listeners are often written inconsistently by different developers and do not take advantage of the extra binding functions like contact(), sum(), and when().  Bindings.select() provides a way to bring POJOs used elsewhere in the app into JavaFX.
